If the dataset does not exist, an error will be thrown.","From there, you can create a stream object.","Additional dataset attributes and methods:"]},{"l":"Streams","p":["Streams are the basic unit of operation in ffysh. Each stream is a lazy-loaded snapshot of a dataset, and it expands as much as the user needs. Alternatively, you can use it as if it is a Python list.","First, store the ID of the stream for later use.","This allows the stream to reload from disk.","Note that each stream instance can only be created or loaded once, and if it is load twice, the old stream instance will be returned.","Stream methods:"]},{"l":"Limitations","p":["You must not use a stream in 2 Python programs at a time. If you want to, create a second stream or quit the first program. Although you still have to re-download labels, images will be cached in a separate directory, so that multiple streams can access the same asset.","Even if assets and their labels are deleted remotely, they will stay intact locally. We'll introduce a way to discard unused streams and purge redundant images in the future."]}],[{"l":"Backed end"}],[{"l":"Releases","p":["This is our Releases section"]}]]
