[[{"l":"Welcome to flockfysh Docs","p":["Just want quick support without any BS? Talk to the guys directly thru https://discord.gg/3pUUQA7b","Welcome, fellow flockfyshers!

You no longer have to spend insane amounts of time and money to build a datset. Give flockfysh a spin, and youâ€™ll have enough resources left over to build 10 more datasets. With our cutting-edge algorithms, flockfysh can auto-generate large-scale datasets that are performant, diverse, and tailored to your specific needs. flockfysh will help you save time and resources, eliminate data bias, and unleash the full potential of your models and applications.","More specifically, we're focused on the following:","State of the Art Computer Vision Problems - Segmentation, Detection, and Classification","State of the Natural Language Processing Problems - Large Language Modeling (think GPT)","We're currently in private beta, feel free to join the waitlist at flockfysh.tech or shoot us an email directly at hey@flockfysh.tech if you'd like to join in with a specific use case."]},{"l":"the 30 second tour for researchers","p":["flockfysh mainly operates through a Python package, and a REST API. flockfysh's Python module also doubles down as a command line interface (CLI), which can be used to expedite various processes.","Our systems are focused on compatibility, and easily integrate into common Python ML frameworks such as PyTorch (2.0 support!) or TensorFlow. We highly recommend taking a look at our python documentation. Our systems easily integrate in, providing you, for example, with PyTorch dataset inferfaces that you can directly apply or inherit to modify.","All of our systems are built with a focus on minimizing the amount of pain (we were ML researchers by profession, as well) you have so that you can focus on pushing the bounds of AI - if you have any issues or need support with our tech, please feel free to reach out to us at support@flockfysh.tech!"]},{"l":"the 30 second tour for builders","p":["If you're working on a process that involves flockfysh datasets, we heavily recommend checking out our API. We've geared our API to be easy to use, and minimally priced (if any).","We recommend using our API in tandem with the Python module - we have a good amount of support for both, and we're constantly working on improvements, based on your suggestions. Again, if there's anything we can help with or any issues, drop us an email @ support@flockfysh.tech."]},{"l":"how to reach us quickly","p":["Docs are great and all, but we also know the pain of having to wade through piles of useless crap.

If the dataset does not exist, an error will be thrown.","From there, you can create a stream object.","Additional dataset attributes and methods:"]},{"l":"Streams","p":["Streams are the basic unit of operation in ffysh. Each stream is a lazy-loaded snapshot of a dataset, and it expands as much as the user needs. Alternatively, you can use it as if it is a Python list.","First, store the ID of the stream for later use.","This allows the stream to reload from disk.","Note that each stream instance can only be created or loaded once, and if it is load twice, the old stream instance will be returned.","Stream methods:"]},{"l":"Limitations","p":["You must not use a stream in 2 Python programs at a time. If you want to, create a second stream or quit the first program. Although you still have to re-download labels, images will be cached in a separate directory, so that multiple streams can access the same asset.","Even if assets and their labels are deleted remotely, they will stay intact locally. We'll introduce a way to discard unused streams and purge redundant images in the future."]}],[{"l":"API"}],[{"l":"Releases","p":["This is our Releases section"]}]]
