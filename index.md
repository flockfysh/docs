# Welcome to flockfysh Docs

Just want **quick support without any BS**? Talk to the guys *directly* thru https://discord.gg/3pUUQA7b

Welcome, fellow flockfyshers! Check out the various API guides we have below, or jump into 
a quick workflow. 

## What is flockfysh? 
flockfysh is the _ultimate solution_ to the dataset problems faced by data scientists, machine learning engineers, and researchers. You no longer have to spend **insane amounts of time and money** to build a datset. Give flockfysh a spin, and youâ€™ll have enough resources left over to build 10 more datasets. With our cutting-edge algorithms, flockfysh can auto-generate large-scale datasets that are _performant, diverse, and tailored to your specific needs_. flockfysh will help you save time and resources, eliminate data bias, and unleash the full potential of your models and applications.

More specifically, we're focused on the following:
1. State of the Art Computer Vision Problems - Segmentation, Detection, and Classification
2. State of the Natural Language Processing Problems - Large Language Modeling (think GPT)

We're currently in **private beta**, feel free to join the waitlist at [flockfysh.tech](https://flockfysh.tech) or shoot us an email directly at [hey@flockfysh.tech](mailto:hey@flockfysh.tech) if you'd like to join in with a specific use case.

## the 30 second tour for researchers

flockfysh mainly operates through a Python package, and a REST API. flockfysh's Python module also doubles down as a command line interface (CLI), which can be used to expedite various processes.

Our systems are focused on compatibility, and easily integrate into common Python ML frameworks such as PyTorch (2.0 support!) or TensorFlow. We highly recommend taking a look at our [python](Python/main.md) documentation. Our systems easily integrate in, providing you, for example, with PyTorch dataset inferfaces that you can directly apply or inherit to modify.

All of our systems are built with a focus on minimizing the amount of pain (we were ML researchers by profession, as well) you have so that you can focus on pushing the bounds of AI - if you have any issues or need support with our tech, please feel free to reach out to us at [support@flockfysh.tech](mailto:support@flockfysh.tech)!

## the 30 second tour for builders

If you're working on a process that involves flockfysh datasets, we *heavily* recommend checking out our [API](API/index.md). We've geared our API to be easy to use, and minimally priced (if any). 

We recommend using our API in tandem with the Python module - we have a good amount of support for both, and we're constantly working on improvements, based on your suggestions. Again, if there's anything we can help with or any issues, drop us an email @ [support@flockfysh.tech](mailto:support@flockfysh.tech). 


## how to reach us quickly

Docs are great and all, but we also know the pain of having to wade through piles of useless crap. If you just want an answer, and want it quickly, **drop by our Discord server** for rapid responses - we're literally online 24/7 (yeah, we have no lives).
