# Overview

> flockfysh, with it's API and CLI, is centralizing data collection, management, and making machine learning more accessible for everyone.

### The Quick Run-Down 
flockfysh is an open platform that enables researchers to be able to openly collect data, filter and validate incoming data points, and then easily run ML pipelines without requiring expensive, in-house computational power.

We function as an exchange that supports _crowdbuilding_ or _buying/selling_ large scale datasets, with options to directly integrate your data collected with state of the art data lakes & warehouses, alongside your fan favorite ML services.

We are a general purpose data collection & management platform, and have seen the most common trends on our platform being the following:

1. State of the Art Computer Vision Problems - Segmentation, Detection, and Classification
2. State of the Natural Language Processing Problems - Large Language Modeling (think GPT)

## Goals 

### Promote OPEN Artificial Intelligence

We're strongly driven by a vision that one day, we'll be able to come together to _openly_ build models, and _come together to collect the data for_ complex AI. AI, as it currently is, hugely relies on large amounts of training data, imprisoning it to the confines of those who can afford it.

### Control.

The most important focus, by far, is on _data ethics_. We empower users to be able to implement their own data privacy policies through a public API, which restricts access to the data and can be used to enforce permissible **commercially** viable licenses, such as by limiting data usage, and restricting how other end users are able to view your data. 

### Build

So you've come up with an idea. You've probably scanned some open dataset platform websites, competitions, and realized that data that fits what you're looking for is really hard to come by. 

flockfysh enables you to directly contact people with data, interact with them, and openly source their data in a way that's consensual, and profitable.

## Status 

We're currently in **public beta**, feel free to try out the early snapshot of the platform or shoot us an email directly at [hey@flockfysh.tech](mailto:hey@flockfysh.tech) if you'd like to join in with a specific use case.

## how to reach us quickly

Docs are great and all, but we also know the pain of having to wade through piles of useless crap. If you just want an answer, and want it quickly, **drop by our Discord server** for rapid responses - we're literally online 24/7 (yeah, we have no lives).

## the 30 second tour for researchers

flockfysh mainly operates through a Python package, and a REST API. flockfysh's Python module also doubles down as a command line interface (CLI), which can be used to expedite various processes.

Our systems are focused on compatibility, and easily integrate into common Python ML frameworks such as PyTorch (2.0 support!) or TensorFlow. We highly recommend taking a look at our [python](Python/main.md) documentation. Our systems easily integrate in, providing you, for example, with PyTorch dataset inferfaces that you can directly apply or inherit to modify.

All of our systems are built with a focus on minimizing the amount of pain (we were ML researchers by profession, as well) you have so that you can focus on pushing the bounds of AI - if you have any issues or need support with our tech, please feel free to reach out to us at [support@flockfysh.tech](mailto:support@flockfysh.tech)!

## the 30 second tour for builders

If you're working on a process that involves flockfysh datasets, we *heavily* recommend checking out our [API](API/index.md). We've geared our API to be easy to use, and minimally priced (if any). 

We recommend using our API in tandem with the Python module - we have a good amount of support for both, and we're constantly working on improvements, based on your suggestions. Again, if there's anything we can help with or any issues, drop us an email @ [support@flockfysh.tech](mailto:support@flockfysh.tech).
